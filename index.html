			<p id = "firefly">Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: You had a gorram time bomb living with us! Who we gonna find in there when she
			wakes up? The girl? Or the weapon? Dr. Simon Tam: I thought she was getting better. Jayne Cobb: And I thought
			they was getting off. Didn't we have an intricate plan on how they was gonna be not here any more? Kaylee Frye:
			We couldn't leave them now. Jayne Cobb: No, now that she's a killer woman, we ought to be bringing her tea and
			dumplings.
			River Tam: You take care of me, Simon. You've always taken care of me. My turn. [she dives through the closing
			doors, grabs the medikit, and throws it to Simon just before the doors close]
			Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: [after landing on Miranda] Well, something sure the hell ain't right.
			Shepherd Book: When I talk about belief, why do you always assume I'm talking about God?
			Young River: People don't like to be meddled with. We tell them what to do, what to think, don't run, don't
			walk. We're in their homes and in their heads and we haven't the right. We're meddlesome.

			<p id="kanye">You are now watching the throne, don't let me get in my zone. You tellin' me people don't look at Kanye West
				like the glitch? I really do believe that the world can be saved through design, and everything needs to
				actually be 'architected.'
				Because I sit back and think 'Am I the only one that's not crazy? I'm a creative genius and there's no other
				way to word it. This one Corbusier lamp was, like, my greatest inspiration. Nobody can tell me where I can
				and can't go. Man, I'm the number one living and breathing rock star.</p>
			<p id = "action">Let me begin baby, my name is <button id="Bronsolino" onclick="actionHighlight();" href="#!">Bronsolino.</button>. Eat steaks off a cold plate. Stoned, listening to Coldplay. Hide
				spinach like a doomsday prepper. Every Sunday I'm in Tuesday leather. My beard look like Uday and Qusay.
				Zero to 60 in a Porsche like a cheetah. The moon's reflections off the lake hit me. All I see is C-notes,
				silk shirts at the casino. The face is silky like a tablecloth. My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach
				like a Chilean horse. I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Grambling. I'm sitting at the outdoor
				desk with my pants off.</p>
